# WindowQuotePro

To run the code there's no secret, it's a Visual Studio WinAPI in C++.
Just open with VS and it should open.

In case it doesn't open, make sure you have: Windows SDK V10.0

The database choosen is SQLite, the external library for its use is inside the project.
There's no need to config anything database related.

If you don't want to run the code, you can just run the .exe file inside.

Inside the program, there's a empty window with 3 menus, one to exit, other to insert
and view the quotes and a About (came with VS and I left).

Best regards,
Tiago
